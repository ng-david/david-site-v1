      <br>
      <p>
        The residents at Neon Heights: Downtown are very satisfied and happy with their <strong>cobblestone wall.</strong> Many believe this wall is what keeps the rapists and murderers outside the city, but the truth is that "The wall keeps them contained inside and away from our other better looking districts" <em>(Mayor Jeremy Chiaramonte). </em>
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Suburban District</h3>
